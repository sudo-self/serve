### Features

* HTTPS (TLS)
* CORS support
* Request logging
* `net/http` compatible

## Installation

`serve` can be installed in a handful of ways:

### Homebrew on macOS

If you are using [Homebrew][] on macOS, you can install `serve` with the
following command:

```sh
brew install syntaqx/tap/serve
```


Here's an example using `docker-compose.yml` to configure `serve` to use HTTPS:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: syntaqx/serve
    volumes:
      - ./static:/var/www
      - ./fixtures:/etc/ssl
    environment:
      - PORT=1234
    ports:
      - 1234
    command: serve -ssl -cert=/etc/ssl/cert.pem -key=/etc/ssl/key.pem -dir=/var/www
```

Then simply open your browser to http://localhost:8080 to view your server.

### Options

The following configuration options are available:

* `--host` host address to bind to (defaults to `0.0.0.0`)
* `--port` listening port (defaults to `8080`)
* `--ssl` enable https (defaults to `false`)
* `--cert` path to the ssl cert file (defaults to `cert.pem`)
* `--key` path to the ssl key file (defaults to `key.pem`)
* `--dir` directory path to serve (defaults to `.`, also configurable by `arg[0]`)
* `--users` path to users file (defaults to `users.dat`); file should contain lines of username:password in plain text

## Development

To develop `serve` or interact with its source code in any meaningful way, be
sure you have the following installed:

### Prerequisites

* [Git][git]
* [Go 1.13][golang]

### Tooling

* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

> __Note__: While the tooling isn't explicitly required in order to build and
> run the project, it's for everyone's benefit that you leverage it.

### Install

You can download and install the project from GitHub by simply running:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:syntaqx/serve.git && cd $(basename $_ .git)
make install
```

This will install `serve` into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, which assuming is
properly appended to your `$PATH`, can now be used:

```sh
$ serve version
serve version v0.0.6-8-g5074d63 windows/amd64
```

## Using `serve` manually

Besides running `serve` using the provided binary, you can also embed a
`serve.FileServer` into your own Go program:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/syntaqx/serve"
)

func main() {
    fs := serve.NewFileServer()
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", fs))
}
```
